Experiment-2

Title

Python Environment, Data Types, Operators, and Basic Input/Output

Aim 

To get familiar with Python's programming environment, learn how it executes code, and understand variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output.

Objectives

• Learn about Python's programming environment and interface

• Understand how Python executes code

• Learn how to use comments

• Understand variables, naming rules, and data types

• Study different operators and expressions

• Learn basic input and output

Theory

Python Environment and Interface

Python gives us different ways to write and run programs:

• Python Shell

• Jupyter Notebook

• IDEs like Spyder, PyCharm, and VS Code

• Cloud platforms like Google Colab

These tools let us write code, run it, and see results instantly.

Python Execution Modes

Python works in two ways:

a) Interactive Mode
• Run commands one at a time
• See results immediately
• Good for testing and learning
Examples: Python shell, Jupyter cells, Google Colab

b) Script Mode
• Write complete programs in a file
• Run the whole thing at once
• Files end with .py extension

Comments in Python

Comments help explain code and aren't executed.

• Single-line: Use #

• Multi-line: Use triple quotes """ """

Variables and Identifiers

A variable stores data values.

Naming Rules:

• Start with a letter (A–Z, a–z) or underscore _

• Can't start with a number

• Case-sensitive

• Don't use Python keywords

Python figures out data types automatically – no need to declare them.

Data Types in Python

Basic types:

• Integer (int): Whole numbers

• Float (float): Decimal numbers

• String (str): Text

• Boolean (bool): True or False

Use type() to check what type a variable is.

Operators and Expressions

Operators do things with data:

• Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

• Comparison: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=

• Logical: and, or, not

• Assignment: =, +=, -=, *=, /=

• Bitwise: &, |, ^, <<, >>

An expression combines operators and values to get a result.

Basic Input and Output Operations

• Input: input() gets data from users (always comes in as text)

• Output: print() shows results

Conclusion

We learned about Python's environment, how to run code, work with variables and data types, use different operators, and handle basic input/output.
